# The FieldRunners Game

This project is ment to mimic the FieldRunners Game. A Tower defence game published
in 2008 by Subatomic Studios. The project's main goal is to review and reinforce 
our knowledge of object oriented programming and event driven coding. The code is pretty much
self-explanatory and is in fact one of the cleanest, most professional cpp codes developed by
me. To start reading the code, you can start at "main/main.cpp".
Good luck,
